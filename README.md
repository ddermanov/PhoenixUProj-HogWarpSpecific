# Example client side mod for HogWarp

To get this working, first install the [UE project for HL](https://github.com/narknon/PhoenixUProj).

Once you have this installed, just copy and paste the Content directory from this repository to your UE project.

You will need to assign a unique chunk id to the Content/HogWarp/Example asset, see [this tutorial](https://modding.wiki/en/hogwartslegacy/developers/getting-started).

Once you have packaged the project, rename the files associated with the chunk id you picked to `Example` so you have Example.ucas, Example.utoc, Example.pak, and move these files in the Mods folder in your HogWarp install.
